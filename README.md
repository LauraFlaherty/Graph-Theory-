# Graph-Theory-
Graph Theory project 2019. You must write a program in the Python programming language that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text.

Steps expected in this project:

1. Parse the regular expression from infix to postfix notation.
2. Build a series of small NFA’s for parts of the regular expression.
3. Use the smaller NFA’s to create the overall NFA.
4. Implement the matching algorithm using the NFA.
