# Graph-Theory-
Graph Theory project 2019. You must write a program in the Python programming language that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression, and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text.

The README should clearly document how to run and test your
program. It should also explain how your program works, and how you wrote it.
